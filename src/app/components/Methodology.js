                    <p className="text-slate-400 text-[15px]">The foundation of this project was based on a strong theoretical background mainly related to teaching and learning techniques, and learning analytics. We adopted a systematic approach by starting with an extensive search for scholarly work to gather, evaluate, and synthesize relevant literature on the subject.</p>
                    <p className="text-slate-400 text-[15px] mt-6">On the theoretical aspect, the cognitive levels of Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy were utilized to classify the three learning levels as beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Afterward, the teaching and learning frameworks identified from past scholarly work were analyzed to establish a theoretical mapping between cognitive levels, learning levels, and lesson learning outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-slate-400 text-[15px] mt-6">On the technical aspect, the established theoretical mappings were used to formulate the necessary prompt templates. This also included leveraging the technique of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to utilize contextually relevant information from a knowledge base. Eventually, the powerful combination of the GPT-4o-mini model and LangChain framework was used for the synthesis and technical simulation of these teaching-learning frameworks. Similarly, an educator-focused Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) was also developed by
                        implementing the stages of the LAVA framework identified during the literature survey. This is also equipped with the ability to generate custom visualizations to cater to varying analytical goals of users, thereby serving as powerful tool for observing and analyzing the learning approach. </p>
